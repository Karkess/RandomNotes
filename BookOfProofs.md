# 4.1 Theorems
*A theorem is a statement that is true and has been proved to be true.*

---
**Theorem**
Let $f$ be differentiable on an open interval $I$ and let $c \in I$. If $f(c)$ is the maximum or minimum value of $f$ on $I$, then $f'(c)=0$.

**Theorem**
If $\sum^\infty_{k=1}a_k$ converges, then $\lim_{k\to\infty}a_k=0$

**Theorem**
Suppose $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a,b]$. Then $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$. 

**Theorem**
Every absolutely convergent series converges.

**Theorem**
If $n$ is a non-negative integer, then $\sum^{n}_{k=0}\binom{n}{k}^2=\binom{n}{k}$

These theorems roughly follow the form or can be put into the form *If P, then Q*.

---
Some theorems of a biconditional statement: $P\iff Q$.

Some theorems simply state facts.

**Theorem**
$$\text{The harmonic series } 1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}+\cdots\text{ diverges.}$$

---
A **Proposition** is a statement that is true but is not as significant.

A **Lemma** is a theorem whose main purpose is to help orve another theorem.

A **Corollary** is a result that is an immediate consequence of a theorem or proposition.

# 4.2 Definitions

**Definition 4.1** An integer $n$ is **even** if $n=2a$ for some integer $a\in\mathbb{Z}$.

**Definition 4.2** An integer $n$ is **odd** if $n=2a+1$ for some integer $a\in\mathbb{Z}$.

**Definition 4.3** Two integers have the **same parity** if they are both even or they are both odd. Otherwise they have **opposite parity**.

**Definition 4.4** Suppose $a\text{ and }b$ are integers. We say that $a$ **divides** $b$, written $a\mid b \text{, if }b=ac\text{ for some }c\in\mathbb{Z}$. In this case we also say that $a$ is a **divisor** of $b$, and that $b$ is a **multiple** of $a$.

*Note*: Be careful with symbols: $8\mid16$ is **TRUE** and $8/16=0.5$, these have unique meanings.
